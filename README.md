Pytorch based reimplementation of [COMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06882): Conservative Objective Models for Effective Offline Model-Based Optimization.

The original tensorflow implementation is [here](https://github.com/brandontrabucco/design-baselines/tree/master/design_baselines/coms_cleaned).

`run_coms.py` is the entry point of the code.

`pytorch_nets.py` contains the surrogate model. 

`pytorch_coms.py`contains the training algorithm.
